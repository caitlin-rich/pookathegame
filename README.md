# pookathegame
You are a little dog in the night. What would you like to do?

Pooka is a game built entirely with HTML and CSS, intended to be practice for a new programming student. Pooka is a black labrador retriever, and is sometimes a total sweetheart, and other times a mischevious troublemaker. Any questions/comments/concerns can be emailed to caitlinboagrich [at] gmail [dot] com.
