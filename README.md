###Pooka the Game

This is built for me to practice HTML and CSS styling, and have fun doing so. I am a new programming student, currently self-learning, and the more hands-on practice I get, the better. Pooka, based on my dog Jolene, is a black labrador retriever. Pooka is sometimes a total sweetheart, and other times a mischevious troublemaker. Any questions/comments/concerns can be emailed to caitlinboagrich [at] gmail [dot] com. 

Pooka is written entirely with HTML and CSS.
